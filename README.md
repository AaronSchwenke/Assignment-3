## Part 1

The linked list is assured to work because the nodes being accessed will be marked and so any other threads operating on the linked list will make sure not to preform any actions that are dependent on those specific nodes. All actions done by the servants are random except in the case where an action cannot be preformed. If the servants had more gifts than thank you cards then it is possible that they attempted to remove parts of the list that weren't there yet still counted their removal. It is also possible that a linked list was not formed correctly and thus nodes were not properly added in a way where the they would be visible in the linked list.
